Two men in black suits and sunglasses were seen visiting a famous radio-astronomer, who recently published some work on a weird and very noisy signal coming from the area of the red dwarf Gliese 388.
Shorty after that, she mysteriously disappeared. The activist hacker group TTIOT obtained and published a copy of her recent research notes, which contained 2 recorded messages.
The first was already preprocessed and decoded. It was "Bang, zoom, straight to the moon!".
The second message was only preprocessed, but not yet decoded.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to decode the second message.

Good Luck!
