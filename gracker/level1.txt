Now things get a little real!

Start by reading the story for this level ("cat /home/level1/story").

Good. Now I'll give you the first hint, use this on gdb "set disassembly-flavor intel".

Now again "disassemble main" and try to understand what the code does.
A good thing to look for is C function declerations. Common functions you will find are:
	gets
	puts
	strcmp
	printf

Notice the vulnerabilities of each of these functions (google it. Some exploits will be mentioned here or later, but just google it).

However, for this level we do not yet need to exploit function vulnerabilities.

Remember that function arguments are passed through the stack (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Disassembly/Calling_Conventions),
 and use this to find what is going on at each point in the assembly code.
