Five women sat in a row at the dinner table. Each had got there in a different way, each was eating a different kind of food, each had brought with her a different object and each had left at home a different pet. 
How were the women arranged, and which woman owned what object?
Invoke submit.py with your solution to obtain the flag. The solution should consist of "woman object" pairs (without quotes, case sensitive), in order of seating from left to right. 

For example:
submit.py Lovelace telescope Germain abacus Franklin laptop Curie pencil Noether scales
IMPORTANT: Give the program a minute or two to produce the flag for you.

Good Luck!
