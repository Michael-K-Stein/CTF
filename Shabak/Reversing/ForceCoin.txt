ForceCoin, an interesting name for a CTF challenge.
What force are we talking about? a brute force.

When downloading the challenge we are getting a zip file that contains a directory.
The content of the directory is:
 - ForceCoin.exe
 - db.txt.enc *
 - ForceCoinTransactionSigner.dll.enc *


Like in each CTF we are running the .exe file to  see what happens.

A window is opened and we are asked to enter a 4 digit code**.
We can try to guess the code but unless you have sidekick abilities you probably  won't guess right.
The 1st option comes to mind is brute forcing and enter all possible codes.

The only problem is that a code that types all the optional codes into the text box and clicks enter is
pretty slow (about 140 hours with pyautogui). So we need ot come up with a better idea.

We should remember that the challenge is under the title of reversing challenges, therefore lets try to
reverse the code. We recommend using dotPeek by JetBrains that writes a C# version of the Code. After decompiling
the .exe file we weill start searching for interesting files in the project.

Lets look on the file ForceCoin/PinForm' we can find there the function buttonCheckPin_Click() that seem interesting.


* After a quick search in Google we can see that a .enc file is encrypted file.
**The Shabak are scamming us' that code can include A-Z a-z 0-9 characters.
