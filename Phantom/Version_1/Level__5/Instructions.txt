The image "ThePassword.png" is the abhorrent result of 
putting the original image through the function "Shift()", 
which can be found in "Source Code.c".

Unfortunately, I'm an a**hole , so I messed a little with the variable names.

Reverse the effects of the Shift function and find the original image.
