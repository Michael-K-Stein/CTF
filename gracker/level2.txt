Welcome to xor keys.

I hope you tried the same method from the lest level, and figured that this level is slightly different.

Now find the encrypted password and the xor key, and do magic!
Remember: the xor key can be one or two bytes, you must make sure you xor the values properly.
 Take a look at line main+124 (0x00000000004008b9) and figure out what is being 'xor'ed.

Also read about little and big endian https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness.

Note that you can examine multiple bytes with gdb with the command "x/16xw 0x01234567" for example which will print 16*4 bytes of data from the location 0x01234567.
