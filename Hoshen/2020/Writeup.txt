This challenge began with a video (no longer avaliable :( ), which had flashing black screens.

Transcribing the flashes into morse yielded the strings: "129.213.32.20", which is clearly an IP address.

Going to the website hosted on this IP (on port 80), we are given an image (jpg) of children building a Sukkah.

Now the real fun begins:

Copy this image and let's start examining it.
First things to check in images (steganography):
	1) zsteg (https://github.com/zed-0xff/zsteg)
	2) binwalk (https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk)
	3) Hex dump / Binary view / strings search

Let's assume we go down the 3rd path (notice that the 2nd path is fastest, and the 1st won't work here).
Looking into the files data, we find the word "Rar!". Interesting, especially since this is the 'rar' compressed file format signature (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures).
Extract the section following (and including) the 'rar' signature (from 0x02F668) to the end of the file.

This rar is password protected, so startup JohnTheRipper using rar2john (https://dfir.science/2014/07/how-to-cracking-zip-and-rar-protected.html).

This is only a matter of time, but eventually you will be told the password is: "Password!".

Now we are given an image called "Payload.png". We can again try the good-old stegano tricks, but this one is a little different;
 We are given stripes of color, and notice that all the colors seem rather dark.
Darker colors mean that all 3 RGB value are on the lower end, possible in the <128 range (proper ASCII).
We can extract all the RGB values using MS-Paint or a script of sorts, but anyway we will end up with the values:
	102 108 097 103 123 077 111 097 100 105 109 032 076 101 115 105 109 099 104 097 125" 
	ascii for 
	"flag{Moadim Lesimcha}"
